# tree-view-camel-case-spaces package

This package adds a spacer between words in file name on tree view if it is written in camel case.
Thus it is easier to read the file name.

For example:
File name `TheFileNameComponentContainerSpec.js` is transformed to `The•File•Name•Component•Container•Spec.js`.
The separator is configurable and can be any string.

For now needs manual directory reload on add/rename/move files.
